# pyramid
This project is about checking whether a given word is a pyramid word or not.

Problem statement: Accept a string as input and return a response indicating whether a word is a pyramid word. 
A word is a ‘pyramid’ word if you can arrange the letters in increasing frequency, 
starting with 1 and continuing without gaps and without duplicates.

Examples:

banana is a pyramid word because you have 1 'b', 2 'n's, and 3 'a's.

bandana is not a pyramid word because you have 1 'b' and 1 'd'.
